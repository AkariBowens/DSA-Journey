# Week One Notes

## Two sum
## Valid parentheses
## Merge two sorted lists
- list1 = [1, 2, 4]
- list2 = [1, 3, 4]
- console.log(list1.val) points to the head - 1
- console.log(list1.next) points to the next number in the list, and shows a "new" list [2, 4]
- sending the next pointer back into the merge function, gives the function new parameters - 
- After the first call, the loop would be mergeTwoLists([2, 4], [1, 3, 4])
- What does assigning the result to list1.next or list2.next do?
